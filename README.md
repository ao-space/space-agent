# space-agent

English | [简体中文](./README_cn.md)

## Introduce

space-agent, as the carrier of AO.space (open source version) all-in-one, mainly provides a unified entrance for AO.space server to start.

space-agent is responsible for binding AO.space server and client, launching AO.space microservices and unified management.

## Feature

- Device Discovery and Binding
- Device Initialization
- Key Exchange
- Microservice Initiation and Management
- Decentralized Identity (DID) generation and management
- AO.space service upgrade and other functions

## Build

We will build a docker image of AO.space (Open Source) related services and make it available for download.

If you want to try to compile and build locally yourself

you can use our [Dockerfile](. /Dockerfile) to compile and build the container image

### Prepare Environment

- docker (>=18.09)
- git
- golang 1.18 +

### Download source code

```shell
git clone git@github.com:ao-space/space-agent.git
```

### Build image

go into project root directory , run this command

```shell
docker build -t local/space-agent:{tag} . 
````

The tag parameter can be modified to be consistent with the docker-compose.yml that is running on the server as a whole.

## Run

### OS

- Linux:
  - EulixOS/OpenEuler
  - Ubuntu
  - Others
- Windows
- MacOS

### Docker

- Docker Engine >= 18.09
- Docker Desktop

### Recommended Hardware Configuration

- RAM： 4G
- CPU： 2 cores

### special hint

You can also run AO.space (open source version) on some development boards such as *Raspberry Pi* etc.

### Getting start

After ensuring that docker is properly installed and running in your environment

To check if docker is running correctly you can use the following command:

```shell
docker version
```

#### run container

*$AOSPACE_HOME_DIR* is  the directory where you want the data to be stored

You can replace it yourself at startup

- Linux

```shell
DATADIR="$HOME/aospace"
sudo docker run -d --name aospace-all-in-one  \
        --restart always  \
        --network=ao-space  \
        --publish 5678:5678  \
        --publish 127.0.0.1:5680:5680  \
        -v $DATADIR:/aospace  \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro  \
        -e AOSPACE_DATADIR=$DATADIR \
        -e RUN_NETWORK_MODE="host"  \
        ghcr.io/ao-space/space-agent:latest
```

if you want to run ao.space on other os, refer to [ao.space self-hosting doc](https://ao.space/docs/install-opensource-linux)

## Notes

### get aospace agent version

```shell
system-agent -version
```

### Query Status

To see if the aospace agent service is working, call the following interface.

`/agent/status`

```shell
{
  "status": "OK",
  "version": "dev"
}
```

### how to enable swagger doc service?

modify `/opt/tmp/system-agent.yml` , change `debugmode: false` to `debugmode: true` ，**and restart agent**。

restart command

```shell
docker restart aospace-all-in-one
```

Open the swagger interface by accessing the address `http://{your-host-ip}:5678/swagger/index.html` in your computer's browser,
where the ip address is the LAN address of your box.
